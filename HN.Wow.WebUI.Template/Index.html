    <h1><em>Fixed positioning</em> &rsquo;fixes&lsquo; the position of an element relative to the browser window. The element always stays fixed in place, even when scrolling.</h1>
    <h1><em>Absolute positioning</em>
    takes an element out of the document flow, meaning the browser acts as if the 
    element has no width and height, and the other elements on the page move up as
    if it was never there. The position of the element is then fixed relative to the 
    top level container, or the closest parent with a set positioning.</h1>
    <h1>
        <em>Relative positioning</em>
        sets the position of an element relative to its original position.
        The element's original width and height is retained in document flow and other elements
        behave as if it was in its original position.
    </h1>
    <h1>
        <em>Static positioning</em>
        is the default behavior of elements. <em>Inherited positioning</em> tells an element
        to inherit its positioning from its parent element. <em>Z-index</em> controls the vertical
        stacking order of elements. Elements must have a set positioning for z-index to work.
    </h1>
    <h1>
        <em>Floating left</em>
        removes an element from normal document flow. It then takes that element and pushes it to the far left 
        as possible. Other elements will move up as far as possible to flow around the element and take its
        original space.
    </h1>
    <h1>
        <em>Floating right</em>
        removes an element from normal document flow. It then takes that element and pushes it to the far right
        as possible. Other elements will move up as far as possible to flow around the element and take its
        original space.
    </h1>
    <h1>
        
        One of the most commonly asked questions is how to <em>center elements</em> since there is no option to 
        float center. But by thinking carefully about how elements behave, we can use positioning to achieve the
        same result.
